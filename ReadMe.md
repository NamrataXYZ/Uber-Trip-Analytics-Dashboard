 - Location Analysis, identifying the most frequent pickup/dropoff points and the farthest trip.

2. Time Analysis
 - This section focuses on time-based trends to identify peak demand hours and days:
 - Total bookings by Pickup Time (hourly distribution).
 - Total bookings by Day Name (weekly trend).
 - A heatmap showing total bookings by the hour of the day and day of the week, clearly identifying peak demand windows.
